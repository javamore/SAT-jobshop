\section*{Abstract}
Job Shop Scheduling problem is a complicated scheduling problem.  In JSS problem, there are many different tasks which can be processed by many different machine at many different time. In this document, we will show the reduction to 3-SAT problem and create a tool to solve this problem by z3 sat-solver. We will evaluate the tool by comparing the behavior between our tool and Google OR tool.

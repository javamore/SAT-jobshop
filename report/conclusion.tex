\section*{Conclusion}
During our research in JSS problem, we learned that there are some other new technics come out recently. For example, in 2004, Reduced Sat Formula (RSF)[4] was published. RSF is a new codification of JSS problem that need fewer clauses in the SAT formula for JSS problem instances than our work. Moreover, this same group come out a more efficient algorithm, which is RandTaunt [5]. However, because we change the topic 2 weeks ago before the deadline, we donâ€™t have much time to get familiar with those new idea. Therefore, we use relatively old algorithm to build our tool. In the future, we will try to implement those new ideas to our tool, and make our tool more efficient.

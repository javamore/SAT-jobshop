\section*{Preface}
At first we are planning to do the research in the topic that not many people did before. Therefore we choose to do research in Kirkman's schoolgirl problem. Kirkman's schoolgirl problem(1850s) is a combinatorial optimisation scheduling problem, and it can be transformed to another well-known social golfer problem(1998). However, in “An Improved SAT Formulation for the Social Golfer Problem”[1], we learn that this problem is NP-complete only if when deciding whether a partially filled schedule can be completed to conflict-free one, and the computational complexity of this problem is currently unknown. Therefore, we plan to do another scheduling problem we found in Google OR-Tools project, which is Job Shop Scheduling problem(JSS)[2]. At the meantime, we found a very detailed tutorial for z3 SAT-solver written by two Microsoft employee[3]. Therefore, our new plan is that we will build a tool to solve JSS by using z3 SAT solver in python, and we can compare our tool to Google OR-Tool in evaluation section if necessary.
